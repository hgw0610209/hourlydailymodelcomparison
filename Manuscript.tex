Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the association
between daily pollution exposure and disease outcomes. To estimate daily
exposure, hourly pollution data are commonly aggregated, but missing
data pose a significant challenge to this approach. To overcome this
issue, some researchers develop models to impute missing hourly data.
Alternatively, daily modelling of pollution exposure can be directly
performed, thereby avoiding the computational burden of hourly pollution
modelling. However, the performance of these two modelling strategies
remains unclear. This paper aims to compare the performance of hourly
and daily modelling strategies in estimating daily pollution exposure.
We hypothesize that daily pollution modelling may provide comparable
results to hourly pollution modelling while saving computation time. We
will use data from Guangzhou city to compare the performance of both
approaches. Results from this study could help researchers decide which
modelling approach to use in future studies, thus improving the
efficiency of pollution exposure estimation in epidemiological studies.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Air pollution is a critical global issue with severe health
consequences. Extensive epidemiological studies have linked daily
pollution exposure to adverse health outcomes, focusing on particulate
matter (PM\(_{2.5}\), PM\(_{10}\)), nitrogen dioxide (NO\(_2\)), and
ozone (O\(_3\)). These pollutants have been extensively studied due to
their prevalence in the atmosphere and associations with respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases, as well as premature mortality among the
elderly. Over the past few decades, recognition of air pollution as a
worldwide problem has led to a proliferation of epidemiological
research, estimating the health impact of outdoor air pollution.

PM\(_{10}\) represents the particulate matter with a diameter of 10
\(\mu m\) or less originates mainly from combustion in domestic heating,
industries, agriculture, and road transport. PM\(_{2.5}\) represents the
particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 \(\mu m\) or less primarily
comes from combustion in domestic heating, industries, and road
transport. It is also influenced by natural sources and atmospheric
transformations, with agricultural ammonia emissions playing a
significant role. NO\(_2\) is primarily emitted by road transport,
particularly in densely populated areas. Combustion processes in
industries and the energy sector are additional sources of NO\(_2\)
emissions. O\(_3\) is a secondary pollutant formed when nitrogen oxides
and volatile organic compounds react under heat and sunlight.
Anthropogenic sources, including industries, energy production,
transportation, and biogenic sources, contribute to O\(_3\) formation.

A report from the World Health Organization (WHO) claimed that 99\% of
the world population was living in places where the WHO air quality
guidelines levels were not met in 2019, and ambient (outdoor) air
pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2
million premature deaths worldwide in 2016 \autocite{WHO2021}. According
to European Environment Agency \autocite{EEA2021}, in 2019, air
pollution continued to drive a significant burden of premature death and
disease in the 27 EU Member States: 307,000 premature deaths were
attributed to chronic exposure to PM\(_{2.5}\); 40,400 premature deaths
were attributed to chronic NO\(_2\) exposure; 16,800 premature deaths
were attributed to acute O\(_3\) exposure. The adverse human health
effects associated with exposures to air pollutants have been well
documented. For example, mortality from respiratory and heart diseases
was significantly related to the level of air pollution \autocites[see
e.g.,][]{Hoek2013,Hodgson1970}, while all-cause mortality was found to
be significantly associated with O\(_3\) levels \autocites[see
e.g.,][]{Huang2022,Anderson1996}. A recent study from by
\textcite{Zhang2021} found that long-term exposure to PM\(_{2.5}\) and
NO\(_2\) was associated with increased risks for non-accidental,
cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. The significance of
accurately estimating pollution exposure in epidemiological studies is
emphasized by these findings. By doing so, we can gain a better
understanding of the health effects of air pollution. Furthermore, these
findings suggest that there may be potential advantages in improving air
quality.

When estimating short-term air pollution effects, daily counts of
disease cases are often regressed against air pollution concentrations
on the preceding few days, utilizing either an ecological (at the
population level) time series design \autocites[see
e.g.,][]{Zhou2021,Krall2013,Gouveia2000} or a case-crossover design
\autocites[see e.g.,][]{Lavigne2022,Liu2019,Di2017,Wing2017}. However,
pollution data are usually hourly monitoring observations with missing
values due to technical problems or equipment malfunctions. To overcome
this issue, hourly pollution data are commonly aggregated to daily data
by taking the mean of hourly values. However, this approach assumes that
the hourly data are missing at random, which may not be true.
Alternatively, some researchers have developed various pollution models
to impute missing hourly data, such as the kriging interpolation method
\autocite{Cressie1993}, the artificial neural network method
\autocite[see e.g.,][]{Cordova2021}, and the univariate or multivariate
time-series imputations \autocite{Hadeed2020}. These models have been
shown to improve the estimation of daily pollution exposure compared to
simple daily averaging.

An alternative approach to estimating daily pollution exposure in the
presence of missing data is to directly model pollution exposure on a
daily basis, which avoids the computational challenges of hourly
pollution modelling. daily pollution modelling entails estimating
pollution concentrations for each day using existing monitoring data and
additional information like meteorological data and land-use
characteristics. This approach offers the benefit of streamlining the
modelling process and minimizing the uncertainty associated with
imputing missing data. However, it may overlook potential fluctuations
in pollution concentrations within a day, resulting in biased estimates
of exposure.

Despite the potential advantages and disadvantages of these two
modelling strategies, the performance of hourly and daily modelling
strategies in estimating pollution exposure remains unclear. In this
paper, we aim to compare the performance of hourly and daily modelling
strategies in estimating daily pollution exposure, using data from
Guangzhou city. We hypothesize that daily pollution modelling may
provide comparable results to hourly pollution modelling while saving
computation time. The results of this study will have important
implications for epidemiological studies of air pollution exposure. By
identifying the strengths and weaknesses of hourly and daily modelling
strategies, we can help researchers decide which approach to use in
future studies. This will improve the efficiency of pollution exposure
estimation in epidemiological studies and enhance our understanding of
the health impacts of air pollution. Additionally, our findings may
inform the development of new methods for estimating pollution exposure
that combine the strengths of hourly and daily modelling strategies.

\subsection{Related work}\label{related-work}}

The main sources of air pollution data in epidemiological studies
include: (a) Monitoring Stations, which are strategically located in
various urban and rural areas to measure pollutant concentrations in the
ambient air; (b) Satellite Observations, where satellite-based remote
sensing is utilized to monitor air pollution on a larger spatial scale;
(c) modelling and Simulation, where air pollution models use
mathematical algorithms and computer simulations to estimate pollutant
concentrations based on emission inventories, meteorological data, and
other relevant factors.

For the purpose of this study, our focus is on addressing missing data
specifically from source (a), which refers to the monitoring stations.
To handle this issue, researchers commonly assume missing at random
\autocite[MAR, see e.g.,][]{Little2019} which is frequently encountered
in environmental health sciences studies, and employ two main techniques
\autocite{Hadeed2020}: univariate time-series and multivariate
time-series methods. These approaches have been extensively utilized to
impute missing data in monitoring observations. Univariate time-series
imputation refers to a class of techniques employed in air pollution
studies to address the temporal characteristics of real-time monitoring
data \autocite{Moritz2015}. One commonly used method is the last
observation carried forward (LOCF), which fills gaps of missing data by
using the most recent observed value \autocite{Engels2003,Plaia2006}. By
employing univariate time-series methods, researchers can estimate
missing values by considering the historical trends and patterns within
the specific pollutant's time series. These techniques utilize the
available data points to predict and fill in the gaps. In contrast,
multivariate time-series imputation involves more sophisticated
techniques that take into account multiple variables and their
interactions. By leveraging the relationships between various pollutants
and environmental factors, these methods can better estimate missing
data points based on the available information. Some commonly employed
methods in this category include regression imputation and predictive
mean matching \autocites[PMM, see e.g.,][]{Rubin1986,Little1988}, row
mean method \autocite[RMM, see e.g.,][]{Engels2003} , multiple
imputation chained equations \autocite[MICE, see e.g.,][]{Rubin1988} and
random imputation \autocite{Moritz2015}.

In a recent study, \textcite{Huang2022} proposed a novel multivariate
time-series model that uses a Bayesian framework to impute hourly
missing pollution data. The response is a mixture of Gamma and
Half-Cauchy distributions, and the correlations between pollutants are
allowed to vary seasonally. The imputation performance of this model is
exceptional, and its source code is openly accessible, making it highly
suitable for replication by other researchers. Leveraging this hourly
pollution model as a basis for comparison in our study, we devised a
novel daily pollution model. The aim of this study is to compare the
performance of the hourly and daily pollution models to determine if the
daily pollution model is sufficient, thus to avoid using the
computationally expensive hourly pollution model. We will briefly
describe the hourly pollution model here (more details can be found in
\textcite{Huang2022}) before presenting our proposed daily pollution
model.

\hypertarget{hourly-pollution-model}{%
\subsection{Hourly pollution model}\label{hourly-pollution-model}}

The pollution measurements exhibit a non-negative and right-skewed
distribution, which makes the Gamma distribution a suitable choice for
representing the response variable. One key advantage of the Gamma
distribution over the commonly used log-Normal distribution is that the
sum of Gamma-distributed variables follows a Gamma distribution as well.
This property plays a crucial role in the data reduction as discussed in
\textcite{Huang2022}.

Let's denote the measured variable for pollutant \(p\) at monitoring
station \(s\) on hour \(h\) of day \(t\) as \(Y_{sthp}\). This variable
can take two forms: either a clean data point following a Gamma
distribution denoted as \(Y_{sthp}^{[\mbox{clean}]}\), or a contaminated
observation with a scaled half-Cauchy distribution denoted as
\(Y_{sthp}^{[\mbox{cont}]}\). Suspicious outliers in the pollution data
include two types: occasional very high values and isolated zero values
on days when all stations have non-zero measurements. The half-Cauchy
distribution is used to accommodate the heavy right tail for the former
outliers and a peak at zero for the latter outliers.

To indicate whether each observation is clean or contaminated, an
indicator variable \(Z_{sthp}\) is introduced. With this notation, the
model can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eqnPollutionhour}
\begin{aligned}
Y_{sthp} \mid Z_{sthp}  = & 
\begin{cases}
Y_{sthp}^{[\mbox{clean}]} &  Z_{sthp} =1 \\ 
Y_{sthp}^{[\mbox{cont}]} & Z_{sthp}=0
\end{cases} \\
Y_{sthp}^{[\mbox{clean}]} \sim & \mbox{Gamma}
\left( \alpha_p, \alpha_p / \lambda_{sthp} \right) \\
Y_{sthp}^{[\mbox{cont}]} \sim & \mbox{Half-Cauchy}(\nu_{p})\\
Z_{sthp} \sim & \mbox{Bern}(\rho_{pt})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The parameter \(\rho_{pt}\), representing the prevalence of
`contaminated' observations, is dynamic and can vary over time to
incorporate advancements in monitoring equipment or significant changes
in the environment that may affect the occurrence of contaminated
observations. These changes can result in an increase or decrease in the
prevalence of contaminated observations. In our modelling approach, we
consider \(\rho_{pt}\) to be piecewise-constant, with a single step
occurring on 1st January 2020. This particular step point is selected to
approximately align with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
\autocite{who_timeline}, aiming to minimize potential bias that may
arise due to the unique circumstances during that period.

The clean measurements \(Y_{sthp}^{[\mbox{clean}]}\) follow a Gamma
distribution characterized by shape parameters \(\alpha_p\) and mean
values \(\lambda_{sthp}\). The means are modeled using a log-linear
approach, as described below. 
\begin{equation}\label{eqnPollutionhour2}
	\begin{aligned}
		\log{(\lambda_{sthp})}  = & \mathbf{X}_{th}^{\top}\mathbf{\psi}_{p} +Q_{sp}+ D_{tp} + C_{stp}\\
		\mathbf{Q}_{s} \sim & \mbox{N}\left(\mathbf{0}, \Omega \right)\\
		\mathbf{D}_{t}  \mid \mathbf{D}_{t-1}   \sim & \mbox{N}\left[\mbox{diag}(\mathbf{\phi})  \mathbf{D}_{t-1} ,\ \mathbf{\Sigma}_t \right]\\
		\mathbf{C}_{st} \sim & \mbox{N}\left[\mathbf{0},\ \mbox{diag}(\mathbf{\gamma}) \mathbf{\Sigma}_t \mbox{diag}(\mathbf{\gamma}) \right] \\
		\mathbf{\Sigma}_t  = &  \mbox{diag}(\mathbf{\delta}) \left[
		\begin{array}{cccc}
			&  &  &  \\
			& \mathbf{\bar{L}}  &   &  {\mathbf{0}}  \\ 
			&  &  &  \\
			L_{t1} & \dots & L_{t,P-1}  &  L_{tP}
		\end{array}\right] \left[
		\begin{array}{cccc} 
			&  &  &  L_{t1} \\
			& \mathbf{\bar{L}}^{\top}  &   &  \dots  \\ 
			&  &  & L_{t,P-1} \\
			& {\mathbf{0}}^{\top} &   &  L_{tP}
		\end{array}\right] \mbox{diag}(\mathbf{\delta}) \\
		L_{tp}  = &  b_p + \mathbf{f}_t ^{\top}\mathbf{\eta}_p
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


The covariates \(\mathbf{X}_{th}\) consist of sinusoidal functions that
capture seasonality at frequencies of 6 and 12 months, indicator
variables for each hour of the day, day-of-week indicators, and a linear
time trend. The fixed effect coefficients \(\mathbf{\psi}_p\) are
pollutant-specific. The hourly influence \(h\) on \(\lambda_{sthp}\) is
solely represented through the hourly indicator variables in
\(\mathbf{X}_{th}\). This approach offers computational advantages by
reducing the dimensionality of the random effects.

In addition to the fixed effects, \(\lambda_{sthp}\) includes three
random effects that are multivariate with four dimensions, corresponding
to each pollutant:

\begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
    $\mathbf{Q}_s$, a station-level random effect with covariance matrix
    $\Omega$;
    \item
    $\mathbf{D}_t$, a first order vector autoregressive time trend with a
    diagonal transition matrix $\mbox{diag}(\mathbf{\phi})$ and
    seasonally varying covariance $\mathbf{\Sigma}_t$; 
    \item
    $\mathbf{C}_{st}$, temporally independent station-time interaction
    effects, with a time-varying covariance matrix which is a rescaling of
    $\mathbf{\Sigma}_t$.
\end{itemize}

The correlation between O\(_3\) and the other three pollutants exhibits
seasonal variability, with a general positive correlation during summer
and a negative correlation during winter \autocite{Huang2022}. The four
pollutants, PM\(_{2.5}\), PM\(_{10}\), NO\(_2\), and O\(_3\), are
arranged in a specific order. The last row and column of the covariance
matrix \(\mathbf{\Sigma}_t\) represent the time-varying covariances
between O\(_3\) and the other pollutants.

To model the correlation structure among the first three pollutants
(PM\(_{2.5}\), PM\(_{10}\), and NO\(_2\)), we utilize a three-by-three
lower-triangular matrix \(\mathbf{\bar{L}}\). This matrix is derived from
the Cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix and involves three
parameters that need to be estimated.

The scalar-valued variable \(L_{tp}\) is influenced by intercept
parameters \(b_p\) and four coefficients \(\mathbf{\eta}_p\). These
coefficients are associated with sine and cosine functions with periods
of 6 and 12 months, which are enclosed within the time-varying factor
\(\mathbf{f}_t\). The specific form of \(L_{tp}\) depends on these
parameters and captures the relationship between the pollutant
concentrations.

In summary, the model accounts for the seasonal variation in the
correlation between O\(_3\) and the other pollutants by incorporating a
time-varying covariance matrix \(\mathbf{\Sigma}_t\), a lower-triangular
matrix \(\mathbf{\bar{L}}\) representing the correlation structure among
the first three pollutants, and scalar-valued variables \(L_{tp}\).

As the model is under a Bayesian framework, prior distributions are
required for the model parameters, and we employ the same priors as used
in \textcite{Huang2022}.

\hypertarget{daily-pollution-model}{%
\subsection{Daily pollution model}\label{daily-pollution-model}}

For daily pollution model, the response variable
\(Y_{tp}=\frac{\sum_s\sum_h Y_{sthp}}{\mid s \mid \cdot \mid h \mid}\)
represents the daily average concentration of pollutant \(p\) on day
\(t\). It is assumed to follow a Gamma distribution with shape parameter
\(\alpha_p\) and scale parameter \(\alpha_p/\lambda_{tp}\).

The log of the mean concentration, \(\log(\lambda_{tp})\), is modeled as
a linear combination of covariates represented by \(\mathbf{X}_t\) and an
additional term \(D_{tp}\). The covariates \(\mathbf{X}_t\) consist of
sinusoidal functions that capture seasonality at frequencies of 6 and 12
months, day-of-week indicators, and a linear time trend. The fixed
effect coefficients \(\mathbf{\psi}_p\) are pollutant-specific.

The term \(\mathbf{D}_t\) represents a random effect component that
captures temporal dependencies. It follows a normal distribution with a
mean determined by the previous day's value \(\mathbf{D}_{t-1}\)
multiplied by the diagonal transition matrix
\(\text{diag}(\mathbf{\phi})\), and a covariance matrix
\(\mathbf{\Sigma}_t\). The covariance matrix \(\mathbf{\Sigma}_t\) is
constructed the same as in the aforementioned hourly pollution model,
accounting for the seasonal variation in the correlation between O\(_3\)
and the other pollutants. \begin{equation}\label{eqnPollutiondaily}
\begin{aligned}
   Y_{tp} \sim & \mbox{Gamma}
   \left( \alpha_p, \alpha_p / \lambda_{tp} \right) \\
  \log{(\lambda_{tp})}  = & \mathbf{X}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{\psi}_{p} + D_{tp} \\
    \mathbf{D}_{t}  \mid \mathbf{D}_{t-1}   \sim & \mbox{N}\left[\mbox{diag}(\mathbf{\phi})  \mathbf{D}_{t-1} ,\ \mathbf{\Sigma}_t \right]\\
\mathbf{\Sigma}_t  = &  \mbox{diag}(\mathbf{\delta}) \left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
 &  &  &  \\
 & \mathbf{\bar{L}}  &   &  {\mathbf{0}}  \\ 
  &  &  &  \\
 L_{t1} & \dots & L_{t,P-1}  &  L_{tP}
\end{array}\right] \left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
 &  &  &  L_{t1} \\
 & \mathbf{\bar{L}}^{\top}  &   &  \dots  \\ 
  &  &  & L_{t,P-1} \\
  & {\mathbf{0}}^{\top} &   &  L_{tP}
\end{array}\right] \mbox{diag}(\mathbf{\delta}) \\
L_{tp}  = &  b_p + \mathbf{f}_t ^{\top}\mathbf{\eta}_p
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Since the model operates within a Bayesian framework, it necessitates
the specification of prior distributions for the model parameters. To
ensure consistency, we adopt the same priors that were utilized in the
previously mentioned hourly pollution model.

\hypertarget{study-region}{%
\subsection{Study region}\label{study-region}}

The study region is Guangzhou, also known as Canton, which is a vibrant
metropolis located in southern China. There are totally 10 pollution
monitoring stations across Guangzhou (see Figure \ref{fig:guangzhou}).
Hourly pollution data from 2017 to 2022 were collected from
\url{http://www.cnemc.cn/sssj/}, including PM\(_{2.5}\), PM\(_{10}\),
NO\(_2\), and O\(_3\).

Table \ref{tab:datasummary2} presents a comprehensive summary of the
mean concentrations and missing data percentages for four pollutants
(PM\(_{2.5}\), PM\(_{10}\), NO\(_2\), and O\(_3\)) across various
stations. In the table, NO\(_2\) shows moderate to high mean
concentrations across all stations, ranging from 22.16 to 48.76
\(\mu g/m^{3}\). O\(_3\) exhibits relatively high mean concentrations,
with values ranging from 49.37 to 63.30 \(\mu g/m^{3}\). PM\(_{10}\) and
PM\(_{2.5}\) have lower mean concentrations compared to O\(_3\), varying
from 37.19 to 55.07 \(\mu g/m^{3}\) for PM\(_{10}\) and from 24.24 to
30.98 \(\mu g/m^{3}\) for PM\(_{2.5}\). The missing data percentages for
all pollutants are generally low. PM\(_{10}\) has the highest missing
percentage among the pollutants, with values ranging from 3.32\% to
9.75\%. PM\(_{2.5}\) has relatively lower missing percentages, ranging
from 1.06\% to 2.85\%.

\hypertarget{study-design}{%
\subsection{Study design}\label{study-design}}

To compare the performance of the hourly pollution model and daily
pollution model, we utilized hourly pollution data from 2017 to 2022 for
Guangzhou city. The dataset consists of variables such as pollutant,
station, value, and date. To facilitate the modelling process, we
divided the dataset into two subsets: a training dataset used for model
fitting and a validation dataset for evaluating model performance.

The validation dataset was specifically designed to assess the model's
performance under different missing data scenarios. We considered two
distinct scenarios: (1) one-pollutant missing across all stations for 50
random days, and (2) two-pollutants missing across all stations for 50
random days. The dataset covered four pollutants: PM\(_{2.5}\),
PM\(_{10}\), NO\(_2\), and O\(_3\). For the first scenario, we examined
four distinct cases: (a) PM\(_{2.5}\) missing, (b) PM\(_{10}\) missing,
(c) NO\(_2\) missing, and (d) O\(_3\) missing. In the second scenario,
where two pollutants were missing across all stations, we analyzed six
different cases, including (a) both PM\(_{2.5}\) and PM\(_{10}\)
missing, (b) both PM\(_{2.5}\) and NO\(_2\) missing, and so on.

By incorporating these diverse scenarios into the analysis, we conducted
a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance under various
missing data situations. This approach allowed us to thoroughly examine
the effectiveness of the predictive model and gain valuable insights
into its applicability for pollutant analysis.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

We employed the Stan software \autocite{stan} to obtain posterior
samples from both the hourly and daily air pollution models. Stan's
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm demonstrates strong performance
in terms of chain mixing and convergence. However, due to the
algorithm's complexity, Stan can be computationally intensive. This
becomes a particular concern in our application, as the dataset
comprises a large number of hourly observations for four pollutants from
multiple monitoring stations. In contrast, the proposed daily pollution
model offers a substantial advantage in terms of computing time.
Recognizing this, our study is motivated by the idea that if the daily
pollution model provides sufficient accuracy, it would be preferable to
utilize it instead of the more computationally demanding hourly
pollution model. In our study, the time required to run a chain with
1000 iterations for hourly pollution models are about 3-4 days, while it
takes only about 1-2 hours for daily pollution models, using Intel(R)
Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz.

Two parallel chains are run for each scenario case with each chain
having 1000 iterations. The first 500 iterations are removed as the
burn-in period, after which convergence has been assessed and confirmed
by the \texttt{monitor} function in Stan.

\subsection{Model parameter
estimation}\label{model-parameter-estimation}}

The main results from fitting pollution models, including the estimates
of unknown parameters, the posterior samples of seasonally varying
correlations between pollutants, are presented in Table
\ref{tab:pollutionModelImplementationboth} and Figure
\ref{fig:varyingcov}, respectively. Overall, Table
\ref{tab:pollutionModelImplementationboth} provides a comparison between
the hourly and daily pollution models by presenting the posterior
medians and 95\% credible intervals for various parameters. It is
observed from Table \ref{tab:pollutionModelImplementationboth} that the
temporal random effects \(D_{tp}\) and their corresponding
autoregressive coefficient \(\phi_p\) exhibit similarities in both the
hourly and daily pollution models. This similarity can be attributed to
the fact that these effects are designed based on a daily unit rather
than an hourly unit, emphasizing the association with days rather than
individual hours. As expected, the coefficient of variation
\(1/\sqrt\alpha_p\) is much smaller from the daily pollution model,
since daily averages tend to have lower dispersion than hourly data.
Moving to the second part of Table
\ref{tab:pollutionModelImplementationboth}, which focuses on the hourly
pollution model specifically. The estimates for \(\kappa_p\) indicate
the variability in the random intercepts for each station \(s\) and
pollutant \(p\). We observe that the estimates for \(\kappa_p\) vary
across pollutants, with PM\(_{2.5}\) and PM\(_{10}\) having lower
variability than NO\(_2\) and O\(_3\). Similar results were observed
from the random intercepts \(\gamma_p\) for each station \(s\) and
pollutant \(p\) on day \(t\). Regarding the contamination measure
\(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\), both of them suggest that the contamination
rate of the data are relatively low in our study.

Posterior samples of correlations among pollutants for both hourly and
daily pollution models are shown in Figure \ref{fig:varyingcov}, and the
correlations between PM\(_{2.5}\) and O\(_3\), between NO\(_2\) and
O\(_3\) for the temporal random walk effect, \(\mathbf{D}_t\), are
different in summer and winter (the correlation between PM\(_{10}\) and
O\(_3\) is not shown here). This speaks to the need for seasonally
varying correlations in the air pollution model.

In this section, we analyze and compare the prediction performance of
the hourly and daily pollution models under different scenarios,
specifically considering the presence of missing data for one pollutant
or two pollutants. In the first scenario, we evaluate the models'
performance when one pollutant is missing across all stations. We
consider four distinct cases: PM\(_{2.5}\) missing, PM\(_{10}\) missing,
NO\(_2\) missing, and O\(_3\) missing. In the second scenario, we
explore the models' performance when two pollutants are missing across
all stations. This scenario encompasses six different cases, such as
both PM\(_{2.5}\) and PM\(_{10}\) missing, both PM\(_{2.5}\) and
NO\(_2\) missing, and so on.

\end{table}

Based on the results presented in Table \ref{tab:hourlydailycomparison},
we compare the prediction performance of the hourly and daily pollution
models in terms of bias and root mean square error (RMSE) for different
scenarios of missing data. In the case of one-pollutant missing, we
observe that the hourly pollution model generally exhibits higher bias
and RMSE compared to the daily pollution model. For PM\(_{2.5}\), both
models show relatively low bias, but the hourly pollution model has a
slightly higher RMSE than the daily pollution model. Similarly, for
PM\(_{10}\), the hourly pollution model has a higher RMSE compared to
the daily pollution model. Furthermore, for NO\(_2\), the prediction
performance are similar for both models, but for O\(_3\), the hourly
pollution model displays significantly higher bias and RMSE compared to
the daily pollution model.

In the second part of Table \ref{tab:hourlydailycomparison}, which
represents the two-pollutant missing scenario, a few main findings can
be observed. In general, the daily pollution models outperform the
hourly pollution models in terms of bias and RMSE. The daily pollution
models generally consistently exhibit lower bias and RMSE values
compared to the hourly pollution models, indicating their superior
prediction performance. When both PM\(_{2.5}\) and PM\(_{10}\) are
missing, their prediction performance is not as good as in the
one-pollutant missing scenario. This outcome can be attributed to the
high correlation between PM\(_{2.5}\) and PM\(_{10}\). Since these two
pollutants are strongly related, having information about one pollutant
greatly aids in predicting the other. Thus, when both are missing, the
models face increased difficulty in accurately predicting their
concentrations. O\(_3\), being a challenging pollutant to predict
precisely, shows higher bias and RMSE values overall. However, the daily
pollution models perform significantly better than the hourly pollution
models for O\(_3\). Despite the inherent difficulty in predicting
O\(_3\) concentrations accurately, the daily pollution models
demonstrate a noticeable improvement over the hourly pollution models,
indicating their effectiveness in capturing O\(_3\) patterns and trends.

Overall, these results indicate that the daily pollution model
outperforms the hourly pollution model in terms of prediction accuracy
for most scenarios of the presence of missing data. The daily pollution
model exhibits lower bias and RMSE values, suggesting its better ability
to capture and predict pollutant concentrations compared to the hourly
pollution model. By incorporating these diverse scenarios into the
analysis, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the prediction
performance of the hourly and daily pollution models under various
missing data situations. These results provide valuable insights into
the strengths and limitations of the hourly and daily pollution models.
They guide us in understanding which model is more suitable for
different scenarios and shed light on their applicability for predicting
pollutant concentrations accurately.

Figure \ref{fig:singleMissing} displays the predicted daily pollution
concentrations in four distinct cases of single-pollutant missing
scenarios: PM\(_{2.5}\) missing, PM\(_{10}\) missing, NO\(_2\) missing,
and O\(_3\) missing. The predictions are generated by both the hourly
and daily pollution models, with the true daily mean indicated in red.
Firstly, it is worth noting that both the hourly and daily pollution
models exhibit good prediction performance. Despite the missing
pollutant in each case, the models effectively capture the underlying
patterns and trends of the pollution concentrations. This observation
suggests that the models are able to generate reliable predictions for
the missing pollutants. Secondly, Figure \ref{fig:singleMissing} clearly
illustrates that the daily pollution model generally consistently
outperforms the hourly pollution model. This is evident from the
narrower boxplots in the daily pollution model, indicating a reduced
spread of predicted values and ultimately resulting in lower RMSE. The
improved performance of the daily pollution model compared to the hourly
pollution model suggests its ability to provide more accurate and
precise predictions regarding the daily concentrations.

Similarly, Figure \ref{fig:pm25pm10missing} displays the predicted daily
pollution concentrations in a specific case of two-pollutant missing
scenario: both PM\(_{2.5}\) and PM\(_{10}\) missing (the results of
other cases of two-pollutant missing scenario are presented in Appendix
to save space). The figure also demonstrates the superior performance of
the daily pollution model over the hourly pollution model in terms of
reduced spread and lower RMSE. Additionally, it highlights the
capability of both models to accurately predict pollution concentrations
when a few observations are missing from the input data.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

When investigating the health impacts of short-term air pollution, it is
common to analyze the relationship between disease cases and air
pollution concentrations over the preceding days. Epidemiological
studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between daily pollution
exposure and disease outcomes. In order to estimate daily exposure,
researchers often aggregate hourly pollution data. However, when dealing
with missing hourly data, some researchers have developed models to fill
these gaps, enabling the estimation of daily exposure through the
aggregation of complete hourly data.

Given the focus on estimating daily exposure rather than solely relying
on hourly data, an alternative approach arises: directly modelling daily
exposure instead of hourly data.

In our study, we conducted a comparison between hourly and daily
pollution modelling strategies to assess their performance in estimating
daily pollution exposure. Our objective was to improve the efficiency of
pollution exposure estimation in epidemiological studies. We
hypothesized that daily pollution modelling could produce comparable
results to hourly pollution modelling while reducing model complexity
and computation time. By analyzing data from Guangzhou city and
considering various scenarios of missing data, we obtained valuable
insights into the strengths and limitations of both modelling
approaches.

Specifically, we analyze and compare the prediction performance of the
hourly and daily pollution models under different scenarios: the
presence of missing data for one pollutant or two pollutants. In the
first scenario, we evaluate the models' performance when one pollutant
is missing across all stations. We consider four distinct cases:
PM\(_{2.5}\) missing, PM\(_{10}\) missing, NO\(_2\) missing, and O\(_3\)
missing. In the second scenario, we explore the models' performance when
two pollutants are missing across all stations. This scenario
encompasses six different cases, such as both PM\(_{2.5}\) and
PM\(_{10}\) missing, both PM\(_{2.5}\) and NO\(_2\) missing, and so on.

Our results clearly demonstrate that the daily pollution modelling
strategy outperforms the hourly pollution modelling strategy in terms of
prediction accuracy for most scenarios of the presence of missing data.
The daily pollution models consistently exhibit lower bias and RMSE
values compared to the hourly pollution models, indicating their
superior ability to capture and predict pollutant concentrations. These
findings support the hypothesis that daily pollution modelling can
provide comparable results to hourly pollution modelling while offering
computational advantages. These findings can guide researchers in
selecting the most suitable modelling approach for estimating pollution
exposure in epidemiological studies. By opting for daily pollution
modelling, researchers can achieve comparable results to hourly
pollution modelling while benefiting from reduced computational burden.
Future studies can further explore and refine the daily pollution
modelling strategy to enhance its performance and applicability in
pollution exposure estimation.
